Here we will set out implentation plans and major updates.
If there are any major changes, please put explanations and date/time here

Personal writing style:
I don't like a ton of nesting. It's ugly and difficult to follow. If possible, please write anything that can be a function into one. 
For an example, look at the data_rec_final file. You'll see I don't go past 4 tabs. If i go beyond that, I should probably be making a function.
Obviously this doesn't always work, but it makes for clean running code that is easier to work on, as the specific funtion that throws an error is easier to work on this way.




Pi Alerts:
Alerts save file
minor/major alerts



data_rec_final:
Each CSV should eventually be seperated by days and saved with a naming convention easy to find.
Data sctructure people online say CSV isn't best for this but I don't know how to use SQL
Need to reset the data list after each run. 
Sometimes return weird times
